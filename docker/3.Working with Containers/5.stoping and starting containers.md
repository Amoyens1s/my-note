# Stopping and Starting Containers
```bash
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                   NAMES
4eb186e4482c   ng-app    "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   4 seconds ago   Up 3 seconds   0.0.0.0:80->4200/tcp, :::80->4200/tcp   cranky_hugle
```
With `stop` command, we can stop the container.
```bash
docker stop 4e

docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```

With `start` command, we can start the container.
```bash
docker start 4e
```

### Difference between `start` and `run`.
With `docker run` we start a new container, whereas with `docker start` we start a stopped container.
