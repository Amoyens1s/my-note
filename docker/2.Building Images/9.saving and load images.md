# Saving and Loading Images

If you want to share the image with others without docker hub, you need to save it.
```bash
docker image save -o ng-app.tar ng-app:alpha-2
```
A tarball will be created after this command is executed.

Then you can use the following command to load the image:
```bash
docker image load -i ng-app.tar
```
