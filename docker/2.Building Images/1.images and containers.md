# Images and Containers

## Images
An image includes everything an application needs to run.

So it contains
+ A cut-down OS
+ Third-party libraries
+ Application files
+ Environment variables
+ And so on...

Once we have an image, we can start a container from it.

## Containers
+ A container provides an isolated environment for executing an application
+ Can be stopped and restarted
+ It's just a process

A container gets it's own file system from the image. But each container has it's own right layer. So what we write in a given container is invisible from other containers. Of course, there's a way to share data between containers. But right now, we only need to know that a container is an isolated universe.
