# What is Docker
Docker is a platform for building, running and shipping applications.

Using Docker, we can bundle an application into an image. Once we have an image, we can run it on any machine that runs Docker.

An image is a bundle of everything needed to run an application. That includes a cutdown OS, a runtime environment (eg Node, Python, etc), application files, third-party libraries, environment variables, etc.

## Container vs Virtual Machine
A container is an isolated environment for running an application.

A virtual machine is an abstraction of a machine (physical hardware). With Hypervisor, we can run Windows and Linux on Mac, vice versa.

### VM
+ Each VM needs a full-blown OS
+ Slow to start
+ Resource intensive

### Containers
+ Allow running multiple apps inisolation
+ Are lightweight
+ Use OS of the host
+ Start quickly
+ Need less hardware resources

All containers share the kernel of the host. The kernel is the core of the operating system.  It manages applications and hardware resources, like memory and cpu.

Every OS has its own kernel or engine. And these kernels have different APIs. That's why we cannot run a Windows APP on Linux. So that means on a Linux machine, we can only run linux containers.

Mac OS's kernel does not have native support for containerized applications. So Docker on Mac uses a lightweight Linux VM to run linux containers.
