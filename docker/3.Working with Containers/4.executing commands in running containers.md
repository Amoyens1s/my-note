# Executing Commands in Running Containers

With docker run command, we start a new container and run a command, whereas with docker exec, we executed a command in a running container.

```bash
docker exec 3d5327745f0a ls

Dockerfile
README.md
angular.json
e2e
karma.conf.js
node_modules
package-lock.json
package.json
src
tsconfig.app.json
tsconfig.json
tsconfig.spec.json
tslint.json
```

With `-it` option, we can open up a shell session. 
```bash
docker exec -it 3d5327745f0a sh

/app $ uname -a
Linux 3d5327745f0a 5.4.72-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Wed Oct 28 23:40:43 UTC 2020 x86_64 Linux
/app $ exit
```
Use `exit` command will not stop the container, it's still running.

So using the exec command, we can execute any commands in a running container.
