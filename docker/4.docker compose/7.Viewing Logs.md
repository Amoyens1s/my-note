# Viewing Logs
We can use the following command to view the logs across all containers of this application in one place.
```bash
docker-compose logs

Attaching to demo_frontend_1, demo_backend_1, demo_db_1
backend_1   | Waiting for MongoDB to start...
backend_1   | Migrating the databse...
......
......
```

So what if we want to view one container's logs? That's what we've already learned in Chapter 3.2:
```bash
docker logs 638

> vidly-frontend@0.1.0 start /app
> react-scripts start
