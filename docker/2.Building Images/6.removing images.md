## Remove Dangling Images
```bash 
docker images

In this list, we have a bunch of images that have no name and no tags. These are what we call dangling images, meaning loose images. These are essentially layers that have no relationship with a tagged image. So as we changing our Dockerfile and rebuilding our image, Docker was creating these layers. And at some point, these layers lost their relationship with our `ng-app` image. 

To get rid of them, we have to use the `prune` command.
```bash
docker image prune

Total reclaimed space: 0B
```

Only one image was deleted in this case, because we still have containers running an older `ng-app` image. 

```bash
docker ps -a

We can use `prune` to get rid of these containers as well.

```bash
docker container prune

Now we run image prune one more time.

```bash
docker image prune

```

Now all dangling images are removed.

```bash
docker images

REPOSITORY               TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
ng-app                   latest    5cafc3499afd   26 minutes ago   540MB
my-os-builderenv         latest    b5931088258e   5 months ago     1.97GB
nginx                    latest    35c43ace9216   5 months ago     133MB
docker/getting-started   latest    3c156928aeec   15 months ago    24.8MB
```

## Remove one or more Images
```bash
docker image rm <REPOSITORY/IMAGE ID>
```

For example
```bash
docker image rm ng-app b5931088258e nginx 3c1
```
This will remove these four images.
