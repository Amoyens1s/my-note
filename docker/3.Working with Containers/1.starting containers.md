# Starting Containers

```bash
docker run ng-app
```
With this command, you can run a container, but you can not execute other commands.

```bash
docker run -d ng-app
```
With `-d`, we can run the container in the detach mode, which means in the background.

Now the terminal is free and we can do whatever we want.

Let's look at the running processes:
```bash
docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS     NAMES
26d1f51d8114   ng-app    "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute             focused_dubinsky
```

Docker automatically associates each container with a random name. So when we want to reference a container, we can either use its ID or its name. We can also give our container a name when starting them.

```bash
docker run -d --name simple-app ng-app
```
