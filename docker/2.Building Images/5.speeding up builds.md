# Speeding Up Builds
An image is essentially a collection of layers. You can think of a layer as a small file system that only includes modified files. So when Docker tries to build an image for us, it executes each of the instructions and creates a new layer. That layer only includes the files that were modified as a result of that instructions.

```docker
FROM node:lts-alpine3.14
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
```
A image contains several layers. But let's just imagine we have a single layer, and this layer includes all the Linux and notifies.

Use the command below we can see how this image was built
```bash
docker history <image-name>

Docker has an optimization mechanism built into it. So next time we ask Docker to build this image, it's going to look at the first instruction and see if the instruction is changed or not. If it's not changed, it's not going to rebuild this layer, is going to reuse it from its cache. Then Docker is going to look at the second instruction.

Once the layer is rebuilt, all the following layers have to be rebuilt as well. So Docker cannot reuse this layer from its cache, it has to install all npm dependencies. And this is exactly where we have a bottleneck.

So we can use the instructions below instead
```docker
COPY package*.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
```

Docker is not going to reinstall all npm dependencies because the `RUN npm install` instruction is not changed.

Like this:
```bash
 => CACHED [2/5] WORKDIR /app                                                                               0.0s 
 => CACHED [3/5] COPY package*.json .                                                                       0.0s 
 => CACHED [4/5] RUN npm install                                                                            0.0s 
 => CACHED [5/5] COPY . . 
```

In summary, you should organize your Dockerfile such that the instructions that don't change frequently should be on the top and the instructions or files that change frequently should be down the bottom.
