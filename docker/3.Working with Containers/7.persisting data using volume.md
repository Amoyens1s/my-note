# Persisting Data using Volumes
A volume is a storage outside of containers. It can be a directory on the host, or somewhere in the cloud.
```bash
docker volume

Usage:  docker volume COMMAND

Manage volumes

Commands:
  create      Create a volume
  inspect     Display detailed information on one or more volumes
  ls          List volumes
  prune       Remove all unused local volumes
  rm          Remove one or more volumes

Run 'docker volume COMMAND --help' for more information on a command.
```

## Create a volume and inspect it
```bash
docker volume create app-data

docker volume inspect app-data
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2021-08-07T07:51:47Z",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": {},
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/app-data/_data",
        "Name": "app-data",
        "Options": {},
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]
```
Here we have a bunch of properties.

We can see when this volume was created.

We can see the driver, which is local by default, that means this is a directory on the host. We also have drivers creating volumes in the cloud. So if you use a cloud platform, you need to do you own research and find a driver for creating a volume in that cloud platform.

Now let's see the mountpoint, this is where that directory is created on the host.

## Run a container and give it this volume for persisting data
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:4200 -v app-data:/app/data ng-app
```
If we don't have the volume or the directory we appoint, docker will create it.

```bash
docker exec -it d3c sh
/app # ls
Dockerfile          angular.json        e2e                 node_modules        package.json        tsconfig.app.json   tsconfig.spec.json
README.md           data                karma.conf.js       package-lock.json   src                 tsconfig.json       tslint.json
```

We can see the data directory is mounted in the app directory as we expected.

But this may cause some problems, if we are not using the root user, we will not have permission to operate this directory. So the better way is create this directory in dockerfile.

```docker
FROM node:lts-alpine3.14
RUN addgroup app && adduser -S -G app app
USER app
WORKDIR /app
RUN mkdir data # use app user to create the directory
COPY package*.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD npm start
```

## Write in volume
```bash
/app $ cd data
/app/data $ echo data > data.txt
/app/data $ ls
data.txt
```
If we remove this container, `data.txt` is still exist. Because this directory is stored outside of this container, it's actually a directory on the host.
