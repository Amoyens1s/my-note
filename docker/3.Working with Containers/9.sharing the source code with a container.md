# Sharing the Source Code with a Container
For production, every times we change our code, wee should build a new image.

But for development, we don't want to rebuild the image every time we make a tiny change in our code. That's too time consuming.

We can create a mapping or a binding between a directory on the host and a director inside ths container. So this way, any changes we make to any files in this directory are immediately visible inside the container.

On linux, we can use $() to wrap a command like `pwd`.
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:4200 -v $(pwd):/app/data ng-app
```
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:4200 -v D:\WorkSpace\my-app:/app ng-app
```
