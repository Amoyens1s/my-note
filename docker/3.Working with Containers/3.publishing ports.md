# Publishing Ports

By default, when you create or run a container using docker create or docker run, it does not publish any of its ports to the outside world. To make a port available to services outside of Docker, or to Docker containers which are not connected to the containerâ€™s network, use the --publish or -p flag. This creates a firewall rule which maps a container port to a port on the Docker host to the outside world.

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:4200 ng-app

docker ps
