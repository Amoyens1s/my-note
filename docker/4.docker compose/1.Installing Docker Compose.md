# Installing Docker Compose
Docker Desktop for Windows and Mac includes Compose along with other Docker apps, so Windows and Mac user do not need to install Compose separately.

### Install on Linux

1.Run this command to download the current stable release of Docker Compose:
```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.24.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

2.Apply executable permissions to the binary:
```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

> Note: If the command docker-compose fails after installation, check your path. You can also create a symbolic link to /usr/bin or any other directory in your path.
```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
```

3.Test the installation
```bash
docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.24.1, build 4667896b
```
