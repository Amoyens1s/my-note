# Building Images

```bash
docker-compose build
```
In our example, we will build three images:
```bash
docker images
REPOSITORY      TAG          IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
demo_frontend   latest       3d988c6f8c12   26 hours ago   299MB
demo_backend    latest       cb699f58ed9e   26 hours ago   184MB
mongo           4.0-xenial   9650de099aeb   4 days ago     430MB
```
When building images with Docker compose, our images are prefixed with the name of our application, which is the name of the directory.

### Question? why these images are created 26 hours ago?
A: When building these new images, docker used everything in the cache, because all those files were already available, all those layers were there. So docker didn't have to do a full rebuild. That is why we are still using the build from 26 hours ago.

### Force rebuild with --no--cache option
```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
```
This option will force docker to rebuild the images.
```bash
docker images
REPOSITORY      TAG          IMAGE ID       CREATED                  SIZE
demo_frontend   latest       977f81b812fc   Less than a second ago   299MB
demo_backend    latest       6e4f25fc5339   29 seconds ago           184MB
```
