# Docker Networking
When we run our application with docker compose, docker compose will automatically create a network and add our containers on that network. So these containers can talk to each other.
```bash
docker-compose up -d
Creating network "demo_default" with the default driver
```
With network command we can see all the networks on this machine.
```bash
docker network ls
NETWORK ID     NAME           DRIVER    SCOPE
174ed623a501   bridge         bridge    local
041fe8bd1020   demo_default   bridge    local
61181a2d2fb2   host           host      local
5b9f94be4df4   none           null      local
```
Every docker installation will has three networks: bridge, host, and none. Notice that we have a network called "demo_default", this network contains three hosts or three containers: frontend, backend, db. These hosts or three containers can talk to each other using their name.
```bash
docker exec -it -u root 638 sh
/app $ ping backend
PING backend (172.18.0.3): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.18.0.3: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.080 ms
64 bytes from 172.18.0.3: seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.066 ms
64 bytes from 172.18.0.3: seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.082 ms
```

Docker comes with an embedded DNS server that contains the name and IP of these containers. Inside each container, we have a component called the DNS resolver. This DNS resolver talks to the DNS server to find the IP address of the target container. So when we ping the API container, this DNS resolver asks the server, what is the IP of the `backend` machine or container. Then the DNS server return the IP address and the `frontend` container can directly talk to the `backend` container using its IP address.

So each container has an IP address, and is part of a network.
